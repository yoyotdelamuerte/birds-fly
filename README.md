# Bird Flocking Simulation
## 💻 Overview
This Python program simulates the flocking behavior of birds 🐦 using the principles of cohesion, alignment, and separation. The simulation is visualized using the Pygame library.

## 🎁 Features
- **Cohesion:** Birds are attracted to the average position of their neighbors.
- **Alignment:** Birds align their direction with the average direction of their neighbors.
- **Separation:** Birds avoid crowding together by adjusting their positions based on the distance to nearby birds.
- **Speed Limit:** Birds have a maximum speed to control their movement.
- **Behavior variation:** Birds have differents behavior for a better simulation.
- **Reset position:** You can reset birds position without need to relaunch the programm.
- **Add bird:** You can add bird when you click inside the windows.
- **Show links between birds:** You can see each interactions between birds when they fly.
- **Change birds colors:** You can randomly change birds colors.
- **See birds concentration:** You can see birds concentration in each area.
## 🔖  Requirements
- **Python 3.12 🐍**
- **Pygame library**
```bash
pip install pygame)
```
## 👤 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoyotdelamuerte/birds-fly.git
   ```

3. 🚀 Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Install the required dependencies.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The Pygame window will open, displaying the flocking behavior of simulated birds.

## 🛠️ Configuration
You can adjust simulation parameters, such as the number of birds, speed limits, and factors influencing cohesion, alignment, and separation in the code.
## 🚙 Controls
- **Press space bar to reset birds positions.**
- **Press "0" on your numpad to change birds colors.**
- **Press "1" on your numpad to see birds connections.**
- **Press "2" on your numpad to see birds concentration.**
- **Close the Pygame window to exit the simulation.**
## 🌱 Acknowledgments
This simulation is inspired by the natural flocking behavior observed in birds and other animals.
