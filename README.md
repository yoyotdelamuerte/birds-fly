# Bird Flocking Simulation
## :computer: Overview
This Python program simulates the flocking behavior of birds :bird: using the principles of cohesion, alignment, and separation. The simulation is visualized using the Pygame library.

## :gift: Features
- **Cohesion:** Birds are attracted to the average position of their neighbors.
- **Alignment:** Birds align their direction with the average direction of their neighbors.
- **Separation:** Birds avoid crowding together by adjusting their positions based on the distance to nearby birds.
- **Speed Limit:** Birds have a maximum speed to control their movement.
## :bookmark:  Requirements
- **Python 3.12 :snake:**
- **Pygame library**
```bash
pip install pygame)
```
## :bust_in_silhouette: Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoyotdelamuerte/birds-fly.git
   ```

3. 🚀 Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Install the required dependencies.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The Pygame window will open, displaying the flocking behavior of simulated birds.
Close the window to exit the simulation.
## :wrench: Configuration
You can adjust simulation parameters, such as the number of birds, speed limits, and factors influencing cohesion, alignment, and separation in the code.
## :car: Controls
Close the Pygame window to exit the simulation.
## :seedling: Acknowledgments
This simulation is inspired by the natural flocking behavior observed in birds and other animals.
